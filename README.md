### Testing Frameworks and Tools
- **Selenium WebDriver:** Essential for automating web browsers and performing web UI testing.
- **Cucumber:** A Behavior-Driven Development (BDD) tool that uses gherkin syntax to write tests in plain language.
- **JUnit:** A popular Java testing framework used primarily for unit testing and integrating into automation test suites.

- **yaml reader:** A tool/library for reading YAML files, often used for configuration or test data in automation tests.

### Database Interaction
- **JDBC:** Java Database Connectivity, an API for connecting to and interacting with databases during automated tests.

### Logging and Reporting
- **Apache Log Generation:** Involves generating log files to track and debug test executions.
